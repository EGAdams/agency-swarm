<b><u>I have scheduled many events in these announcements</u></b><b>. </b>As always I need to alert you to the possibility events may get disrupted by unforeseen happenings so be aware that things can get rearranged sometimes.

<b><u>FYI:  The widow’s group who meet in our building will meet on the second Saturday of the first three months of 2024 at 5:30 PM.  </u></b>We do have an understanding that as they are using the fellowship hall, kitchen, and bathrooms, we are free to be in the sanctuary, bathrooms, i.e.,  all rooms other than the fellowship hall and kitchen.

<b><u>Senior singles (55+) meetings:  </u></b>The forthcoming dates are: <b>2/3/24, 3/2/24.</b>

<b><u>The books we are studying now are Psalms and Ecclesiastes.</u></b><b>    </b>

2/1: <b><u>September and October ,  ’23 ROLLWMS work is due.  The assignment for November paperwork was to complete the deliverance form – everyone did that.  The January work is due on 2/16.  The February work will be due on 3/8.</u></b>

2/3 : <b><u>ROLLWMS   The students will teach in the 9:30 AM service; Communion will be shared in the 11 AM service.  In the school we will continue to deal with deliverance. </u></b>

2/4:  <b><u>We will begin the study of Proverbs, James, and John</u></b>

2/15:  <b><u>Board meeting</u></b>:  6:45 PM.  Potblessing first then the meeting which includes the final finance reports of 2023.

2/17:  After our second Sabbath service, <b><u>The <span class="il">ROL</span> family is having a baby shower for Leeland Jack Schneider, the new baby of Dylan and Hannah Schneider </u></b><b><img class="an1" src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f60a/72.png" alt="😊" data-emoji="😊" aria-label="😊" /></b><b> .  </b>Pastor Karen Cook is in charge of this shower (she may be approaching some of you for assistance).

Go to the Baby registry on Amazon.com if you need ideas for a gift for the baby.

This shower is not going to be a “pot blessing”(as is often our plan). Other plans are being made for the refreshments this time.

2/22: <b><u>7PM Our annual positioned leadership holiday (post-holiday) gathering</u></b>.  This is a potblessing.  We will simply have a time of table fellowship with intentionally tasty, joy producing food and we will  exchange gifts (keep them around 15.00 and a bit under…). Guys bring a guy’s present; Gals bring a Gal’s present. Spouses are welcome to this gathering.  Any baby boy under three months old is also welcome; but, he must provide his own seating arrangement.  (That is a special deal for this year….) We can dress up a bit – but the goal is a warm time of simple fellowship together.

<b><u>Annual fasting time</u></b>:  The following is a span of thirty-one days :   3/27/24 through 4/26/24.   Pick <b><u>twenty-one days</u></b> out of this timespan to fast. If something prohibits that time span from working for you, feel free to start earlier than 3/27 to complete twenty-one fasting days.   Please send your prayer requests (and those of your dependent children)  to the entire mailing list by 3/27.   (Simply “reply all” to one of the announcement emails to be able to use that list.) This year please put your requests and those of your children into the prayer bowl provided on 3/27.  That is the night we will begin praying for your requests.  You may continue to add additional prayer requests into that bowl right up until 4/24.  <i>This year , as you can see, I , Rosemary , am putting all responsibility of getting the requests into the emails and into the bowl to you, the people of River of Life.   </i>

For each person put their full name on the paper and the prayers requests. IF it is a long list (more than ¼ of an 8 ½ x 11 sheet), break the requests into ¼ sheet form .  Be sure to add the name to each piece of paper you place in the bowl.

In the email it is optional whether you <i>add</i> how you choose to fast. Feel free to include activities you may choose to refrain from or “good works” you intend to do; <i>but</i>, <i>be sure to have a fast from certain food as well</i>.  Everyone chooses their own fasting plan.   You may choose to break your fasting plan up into more than one pattern : E.g., “I will do a liquid fast for ten of the days and one meal a day for the remaining eleven.” Sometimes I choose to state my plans because –for me -- it seems easier to be faithful when I have declared my plan.

2/24<b>:  <u>Around 3 PM Robert and I, Rosemary, will be performing a simple wedding ceremony for our niece in the sanctuary</u></b>.  Just a few people will be present. Please respect this event by moving into the fellowship hall if you are still there and you can see the wedding participants are arriving. We are using only the sanctuary for this event -- whatever happens in the fellowship hall is not going to disturb the wedding.

<b><u>Pastor Robert’s 83<sup>rd</sup> birthday is on 3/3.  We will take a birthday offering for him on 3/2.</u></b>

<strong>5/19</strong>:  <b><u>We begin to study Jeremiah, Lamentations, and Philemon</u></b>

<strong>6/1</strong><b><u>:  Light Force begins </u></b><b><u><img class="an1" src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f60a/72.png" alt="😊" data-emoji="😊" aria-label="😊" /></u></b><b><u>   </u></b>Every Saturday night at 7:30 PM we meet downtown by Kilwin’s Ice cream place , across from Rosa Parks Circle and pray together for an opportunity to bless people with prayer and the gospel.   Whatever the Lord wants to do with us is fine: E.g.,  we are delighted to be used in the gifts of the Spirit, in encouraging fellows Christians , and in exhorting a backslidden believer.  It is thrilling when we get a chance to lead someone to the Lord for the first time !  After we pray to be led by the Spirit, for around an hour we go around the area on foot and approach various people (as we feel led) to minister to them. Some  prefer to be with others as they minister, and others prefer to minister alone. Either way is fine.  After we are done with the ministry to the people,  The Light Force participants meet again by Kilwin’s  to  share about what happened during the time of ministry.

We meet every Saturday night unless it is raining or below 68 degrees outside. If Light Force is canceled for any other reason, we will text all regular participants (or announce it in the morning at church).

Each year we begin Light Force the first Saturday after Memorial Day and end Light Force after Labor Day.

10/19<b>:  <u>We celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. </u></b>The suggested theme this year is “Praise be to our Father, our Provider, Now and Forever”.   The Feast itself , in addition to celebrating the provisions from a natural harvest , is also a commemoration of the Lord’s care for Israel when He delivered them from Egypt and provided for their every need in the desert as they travelled to the promised land of Canaan.

<b><u>Tentative plan</u></b><b>: </b>Robert and Rosemary go to Florida from 10/20 to 11/1.
