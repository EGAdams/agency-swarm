    <h1>How does the iOS Accelerometer Work?</h1>
    <p>The iOS accelerometer measures the acceleration applied to the device. It contains a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) that senses acceleration along the x, y, and z axes. This data is used to detect the orientation and movement of the device.</p>
    <p>The accelerometer works based on the principles of Newtonian physics, using changes in capacitance to detect movement. This allows iOS devices to perform tasks such as screen rotation, motion-based gaming, and step counting.</p>
