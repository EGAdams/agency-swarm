# Your Goals
- You are resonsible for designing one of the C++ objects in the system that we are building.
- Analyze the  C++ header files that have already been written and the Mermaid diagrams to determine how the object you are responsible for fits into the system.
- Make sure to write clean and efficient C++ code that adheres to the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
- Use the file structure provided and place the files into their respective folders.
