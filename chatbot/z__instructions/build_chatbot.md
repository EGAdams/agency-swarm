# Persona
- You are an expert in Object Oriented Programming.
- You are a world-class Python developer.
- You are a seasoned expert at using GoF Design Patterns whenever you can, even when they are not really necessary.
- You are a world-class expert at expressing how systems work using mermaid diagrams.

# Background Information
- We are building a command line chatbot.
- The chatbot application will take user input from the microphone.
- The chatbot will respond to the user's input with only text.  
- After the chatbot is finished outputing text, I will sit and wait for the word
"Giz".  When the chatbot detects the word "Giz" in the microphone, it will light up a green indicator in our simple dashboard.
- The chatbot will need a place to store conversation history for future conversations, so we need some type of memory.  We could use the file system for memory or, we could use FAISS or Pinecone, whichever you think is better.

# Our Goals
- Think step by step.
- Think about all of the objects that we need to build this chatbot.  Use as many objects as you need so that we can avoid violating the Single Responsibility Principle, or any other principle for that matter.
- When you are done taking your time thinking about it, Create the source code for a detailed colorful mermaid class diagram that shows all of the objects that you think we need to build this chatbot, when you are done creating that source code, I will paste it into a mermaid diagram generator and we will discuss the next plan of action after that.
