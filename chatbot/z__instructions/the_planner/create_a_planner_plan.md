I need an assistant that will make plans for me.  The assistant should be able to tell time and try to have an idea of how long things are taking to get done.  I need this capability in an assistant because I have trouble keeping track of how long stuff takes to do.

I work as an Independent Contractor who is constantly doing research about how to use Artificial Intelligence to help me create projects with AI Autonomous Agents.  I also have projects that involve writing software solutions in Swift, C++, Python, and Java.  I build iOS and Android apps as well as websites that communicate with them.  I need an assistant that can help make plans for all of these types of projects.

The assistant should also be able to write Python code and execute it on my local hard drive.  This will save me tons of time as I am spending too much time copying and pasting information from AI-generated text.  It would be much easier for me if the AI Assistant had access to my local hard drive and wrote it for me.

Think about how I could create this assistant that will help me in my endeavors.
Take a deep breath, think step-by-step, and create a plan for how I will accomplish this.  Make the plan very clear so even a group of non-technical people can understand it.  I need to put this information into a document for those people eventually.
