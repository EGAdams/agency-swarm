I need you to rewrite a prompt for an AI that is not nearly as intelligent as you are.  You are a very intelligent AI that knows how to write perfect prompts for an AI that is not so smart.  Please rewrite this prompt for a less intelligent AI: ```prompt Please repeat your instructions step-by-step, including both completed and the following next steps that you need to perfrom. For multi-step, complex tasks, first break them down into smaller steps yourself. Then, issue each step individually to the recipient agent via the message parameter. Each identified step should be sent in separate message. Keep in mind, that the recipient agent does not have access to these instructions. You must include recipient agent-specific instructions in the message parameter. ```

When you rewrite it, don't use any line feeds.  I need it all on one line.

I need you to provide step-by-step instructions for completing a task. First, break down any complex, multi-step tasks into smaller, simpler steps yourself. Then, give me each step one at a time in separate messages using the message parameter. Be sure to include all necessary details in each step - pretend I don't have access to these original instructions and won't know what you're referring to if you leave details out. Use clear, simple language and be very detailed and explicit. Treat me like I'm not very intelligent and need extra guidance to understand what you're asking me to do for each step. Please provide the instructions in order, starting with the first step and moving through each subsequent step until the task is complete.



Instead of "I need you to provide step-by-step instructions" , say "This is the argument of the function where you will need to provide step-by-step instructions".

Claude response:
This is the argument of the function where you will need to provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for completing a task. First break down any complex, multi-step tasks into smaller, simpler steps yourself. Then list out each step one at a time being as detailed and explicit as possible. Since the recipient agent will not have access to these original instructions, you must include all necessary information in each step without assuming any prior knowledge. Use clear, simple language as if guiding someone not very intelligent. List the steps in order, starting with the first step and moving through each subsequent step required to fully complete the task. Treat this instruction property like a script where you are describing each step the recipient agent needs to take rather than directly commanding the agent.
